* COLLECT RAW DATA IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE FORMATTING

* PROCESS AND SAVE THE RAW DATA TO CSVS FOR EASY FORMATTING AND ACCESS, WHILE KEEPING THE COMPUTATION TIME LOW

* USE THE PROCESSED DATA TO START GENERATING THE EXPIRMENTAL CONTSTANTS AND GRAPHS (TRY TO KEEP THE CODE EFFICIENT AND ORGANIZED)

* PLOT THE DESIRED GRAPHS AND DETERMINE FIGURE CONVENTIONS FOR CLEAR VISUALIZATIONS IN THE REPORT (FIGURE SIZE, AXIS FONT SIZE, ETC.)

* WHEN THE NUMERICAL AND EXPIRMENTAL DATA HAVE BEEN PROCESSED AND GRAPHS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED, COMPARE THEM IN A SEPERATE FILE. SAVE ANY IMPORTANT RESULTS

Code conventions: (Feel free to disagree with these and suggest alternatives)

File naming:
* Start by writing the dimension that the file is dealing with (2D or 3D if applicable)
* Then indicate wether you are working with EXPIRMENTAL or NUMERICAL data in the file (EXP, or NUM, or ALL)
* Then indicate what the file will be used for (e.g. Calculationing Pressure Coefficients)
Example: 2D_EXP_Pressure_Coefficients.py

File formatting:
* File description (and who the file was written by)
* File imports (external and internal)
* Functions
* Constants and Calculations
* File running logic (see e.g. Ambient_Conditions.py)

Variable naming:
* Please just be clear so that others can understand what you are doing.

Functions:
* Add a description in the function so that others can follow the calculations.
